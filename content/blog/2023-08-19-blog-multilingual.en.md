The title says it all, and this post is simply to announce it. From now on, all articles will be available in both English and Spanish.

That means that, on the one hand, existing articles have been translated into English and, on the other hand, new articles will be published in both languages. My intention is to keep this so that the whole blog is always in both languages.

The default language will be English, but it will always be possible to change it from the new selector that has just appeared at the top. Although English is the default language, if a person comes to the blog, the language will be determined by the language of their browser, so if you access from a browser in Spanish, the content will still appear in Spanish. For the rest of the cases, by default it will be shown in English.

Although it may seem like more work for a blog with which I am anything but constant, I find it interesting to have it in both languages as it helps me to force myself to write and translate content into English (my mother tongue is Spanish), so it will help me to improve my level. Also, if one day I take this really seriously, having it in English can make the content reach a wider audience.

In the future, if I manage to keep it up, I might consider doing something similar (although not completely) with some of the articles, but in Basque, although that's something for the future.

Finally, I apologise in advance if there are typos in English or if my way of writing in English is a bit odd. The content is not translated by professionals but by me (sometimes with tools, let's not pretend we don't), so it won't be perfect (it's not perfect in Spanish, less will be in English XD).

*Happy Hacking!*
