As you may have noticed, my name is Ander Granado. I'm a computer engineer, software developer, and hacker.

This is my blog, where you can find articles about the things I'm tinkering with, whether it's programming, hacking, or anything that might cross my mind. In addition to that, you'll encounter very little consistency in terms of posting frequency and a relatively chaotic and acid language.

I also have a set of social networks where you can follow me. I have [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andergrma/), where I mainly post photos of my travels and things I'm reading (very hipster, I know). I also have [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andergrma) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@andergrma), which, if I haven't abandoned them, are what I use to stay updated on new things in the world of development, follow artists, and so on. Lastly, even though it's not a social network, I have [GitHub](https://github.com/ander94lakx), where I have some projects uploaded, ranging from old university projects to some little things I'm working on (like, for example, this very blog).
